Merging cells using keyboard shortcuts
If you want to access commands on the Ribbon in Excel using your keyboard, you can press Alt to display key tips and then press the displayed key(s).

To merge cells using keyboard shortcuts (key tips):

Select the cells you want to merge by dragging over the cells or click in the first cell and Shift-click in the last cell. The cells must be adjacent to each other.
Press Alt > H > M (this is a sequential shortcut so press Alt then H then M). A drop-down menu with merge options appears in the Ribbon.
Press the displayed letter for the command you want. The data in the top leftmost cell or uppermost cell will be merged across the selected cells. Data in the other cells will be removed.
The following are the keyboard or key tips shortcuts for merging and unmerging cells:

Merge & Center – press Alt > H > M > C.
Merge Across – press Alt + H + M + A.
Merge Cells – press Alt > H > M > M.
Unmerge Cells – press Alt > H > M > U
